# hackathon_2024
Igniting the Nature Backed Economy

Igniting the Nature Backed Economy is a regenerative finance hackathon - aiming to bring advancements to land based DAOs, community land trusts, and other forms of commons governed or built on-chain in the Ethereum ecosystem. The hackathon will offer a chance for builders to create tools for land based DAOs and community projects leveraging technology to access, govern, and regenerate commons.
